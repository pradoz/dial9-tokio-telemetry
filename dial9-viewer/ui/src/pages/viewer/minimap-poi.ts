// the issues rail (filterPointsOfInterest over reconstructed worker spans),
// read independently.
//
// The minimap is an OVERVIEW, so it unions the applicable detectors instead of
// a single selected filter: every notable point earns a tick. Derivation is
// O(events) and belongs in a trace-keyed derived() cache (the component
// installs it), so pan/zoom never re-derive it.
//
// "cpu-sampled" is deliberately excluded: it needs attachCpuSamples, which
// MUTATES the shared poll objects the lanes/overlay caches also hold - the
// minimap must not reach into that shared derivation. The remaining detectors
// (long-poll, sched, wake-delay, uninstrumented, spawn-delay, off-cpu-active)
// read the spans read-only.
//
// "spawn-delay" runs at its DEFAULT threshold, not the rail's live one: these
// ticks are cached on trace identity, and rebuilding them on every threshold
// edit would trade a stable overview for a flickering one.
//
// Each detector contributes its worst MINIMAP_POI_LIMIT points, not everything
// it matched. The detectors rank instead of thresholding, so an uncapped union
// would ink a tick for every poll in the trace and say nothing.
